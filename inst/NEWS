Set Version no to 0.99.0 in preparation for addition to Bioconductor

Release 1.1.6 (Sep. 28, 2009)
Documentation:
  + All 'Suspect-Links' removed, which refer to the documentation pages in other packages.

Release 1.1.5 (Sep. 28, 2009)
API:
  + Checked for the release in the new BioC life cycle
Documentation:
  + Vignette have been filled with transformation algorithms, However the statistical procedures still need to be described.

Release 1.1.3 (Aug. 25, 2009)
Internal:
  + 'interpolationTrasnform', which calls either 'spline' or 'approx' to interpolate RTCA results along the time, is added
  + 'myheatmap.2' is added to visualize the RTCA time-course data with heatmap
  + 'rtcaWatershed' class (with methods) and 'rtcawatershed' function is added. The algorithm detects peaks in the RTCA data
File structure:
  + 'algorithms.R' and 'visualization.R' are added to make 'RTCAfunctions.R' rather a collection of miscellaneous functions.

	* combineRTCA(list): Additional column is renamed into Plate. The vlues
	is evaluated from list item names. When the list has no name, an
	integer index beginning from 1 is used. Special attentions to list
	partially with names is noted in the documentation.

	* parseRTCA(file, dec=".",phenoData, skipWell,...): Example is
	added in the documentation how to import pre-configured
	phenoData. Details section in the documentation is re-written to
	describe the process of parsing.

	* RTCA-class: Experiment ID added to RTCA class

	* Makefile: add Makefile to simplify common tasks like check and install

	* plotGridEffect: takes 'column' instead of 'col' as mode
	parameter, and renders the mode as the title of the
	legend. Documentation updated.

	* plotRTCA: is removed from the package and is substituted by the
	plot function.
